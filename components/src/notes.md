Faker.js
--> open source library for generating fake data.
--> The API methods list all the types of data that it can generate
--> `npm install --save faker`
--> The docs basically gives what you can generate
--> You can do that by selecting a category and then the subcategory is a function. So, if you selected image then you can consider as an object (probably, (Just for understanding)) and using it u can access the function avatar for it

    `faker.image.avatar()`

--> sometimes it might not even give an avatar for the example like that but refreshing the page will bring it back up.
